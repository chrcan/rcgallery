==========================
TYPO3 Extension rcgallery
==========================

This image gallery creates a title that serves as a link for the gallery.
You can also select a creation date and a description of the gallery is also possible.

The only thing you have to do is embed the typoscript in the template and create a folder for your gallery in the page tree.

It is best to name this Gallery.

Now you can select and create the gallery in the created folder with List.
Have fun :-)
